1.SQL QUESTION
if the where condition was applied before the JOIN:
*only employees matching the date range would be considered for the JOIN.
*department without any employees in that range would be completely removed from the result.
*This effectively converts the left JOIN into an INNER JOIN an unmatched departments are eliminated.
*Some departments that should have appeared with employee_count = 0 would no longer be included.
